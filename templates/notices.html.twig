        <strong>There are 2 reasons why there haven't been many frontend changes lately, they're worth it though!</strong><br />
        <br />
		I've prepared the first version of the <strong>public API</strong> and need some feedback on the documentation and the actual API
		before I declare this version final and add the link to it permanently to the website. <br />
		You can find the documentation on <a href="https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy/wiki/API-v0.9">the wiki</a> on github. <br />
		<br />
		There's also been a lot of change to the crawling code, resulting in now being able to crawl items at (insanely) <strong>higher frequency</strong>! <br />
		I actually had to force it down a bit because my database is exploding and I need to optimize that!
