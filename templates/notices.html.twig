        <strong>Performance and WATCHLIST!</strong><br />
        <br />
		I've been working my ass off to keep the performance under control and finally I think I've got it at a point where I can start working on actual features again! <br />
		<br />
		<br />
		First up coming feature will be <b>watchlist / favorites</b>, it's 95% done already, just need to test it ...
		stayed tuned (on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gw2spidy">twitter</a>) for a possible beta :-)

        <strong>Performance and WATCHLIST!</strong><br />
		As a small test the next few hours there won't be any moving averages in the charts ... I want to know how much performance impact that has ;-)<br />
