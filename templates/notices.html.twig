        <strong>WATCHLIST!</strong><br />
        Thanks to <i>TehGear</i> for setting up the base and myself for implementing the (social) login. <br />
		So right now you're looking at the first version containing the <b>watchlist / favorites</b>! <br />
		You can now login (using facebook/twitter/google if you like) and mark items as favorites so they end up on your watchlist! <br />
		Based on this I can continue with features such as notifications etc. when prices go up / down!

        <strong>Vendor Prices! And Search / Filters improved!</strong><br />
        I added a way (for me) to manually set vendor prices for items and to import gw2db vendor prices once they have the data. <br />
        Thanks to <i>Zhgch</i> for providing me with some prices for a bunch of items most of the basic stuff is covered! <br />
        <br />
        If you see some more prices missing, just tweet them to me or get on IRC or smt and I'll add them :-) <br />
        <br />
        I also added recipes to the search. And added level filters to both item and recipe lists (recipes it's the crafting level) \o/
