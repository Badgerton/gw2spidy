        <strong>Thanks for voting in the poll!</strong> <br />
        With 35% of the votes, crafting recipes (cost and profit) is the next up coming feature! <br />
        I think I'll be able to work together with the awesome people of <a href="http://www.gw2db.com">gw2db.com</a>, this might also result in having their pretty tooltips for items ;)<br />
        <br />
        There were some other nice sugestions too, I hope I'll be able to include some of those in the near future too! Thanks a lot!
