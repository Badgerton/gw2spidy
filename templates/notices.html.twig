        <strong>I'm back! \o/</strong><br />
        Lately I haven't had any time at all to work on gw2spidy and I'm sorry for that! <br />
        It's been crazy @work and now finally it's going to cool down a bit and I'll have time to answer a lot of open mails, fix some small bugs and think about the future of gw2spidy :-)<br />
        <br />
        Thanks for sticking around and stay tuned for an awesome new feature that has been semi-done for way to long and I'll finish asap!
