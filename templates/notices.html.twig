        <strong>Downtime <i>two</i> nights in a row, sad panda :-(</strong><br />
        The downtime is caused by the server crashing down completely to the point where it needs a full restart to start working again.<br />
        It's never easy to investigate this kind of problems, but it seems to be related to the server having a really hard time keeping up with the usage.<br />
        <br />
        I've improved some things (server configuration, script optimizations and some monitoring setup) to prevent problems or better find out what's going on.<br />
        <br />
        The biggest chunk (like 90% or more) of the load on the server is caused by the API ( I never imagined this would become such an success xD ) and the past few days even more because somebody was doing requests for all the item listings at an insane rate.<br />
        I talked to that person and he changed his script to be less heavy and also improved the performance of the listings API.<br />
        <br />
        I'll be closely monitoring the server tonight, hopefully the problems are already fixed and otherwise I can promise you I'll be right on top of it when anything goes wrong tonight!<br />
        <br />
        I'll also implement something to rate limit the API access a bit to at least prevent the amount of request reaching DOS attack levels like they were now :P<br />
        <br />
        Hope you can forgive me for letting it fail 2 evenings in a row and to offset this I'll ensure I get enough time this week to add a awesome new feature where you can play around with various filters to find the PERFECT list of items to sell / buy ;-)<br />
